This week is the [Docathon](https://bids.github.io/docathon/) at [BIDS](https://bids.berkeley.edu/) (a.k.a. that wonderful place that I spend all my time). 

A docathon is like a hackathon but is focused on developing material and tools for documentation. We have [loads of projects](https://bids.github.io/docathon/pages/projects/projects.html) signed up to receive some documentation-love and an impressive number of excited participants!

```



We kicked off the event with a series of tutorials for writing "good" documentation. I gave an R-specific tutorial where I discussed using devtools to both develop and document your package. I ended with a sneak peak into bookdown book-based documentation for complex packages. Skip ahead to 1:54:02 to hear my presentation!

The materials for my tutorial can be found in this [github repo](https://github.com/rlbarter/R-documentation). Stay tuned for a more detailed blog post about writing documentation in R.
