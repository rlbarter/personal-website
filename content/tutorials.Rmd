I have made a number of tutorials on a variety of R- and statistics-related topics. The list below shows descriptions of and links to these tutorials. Keep an eye on this page -- I'm always adding more!


## R packages

- [across](https://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2020-07-09-across/): a summary of the `across()` function which replaces the select helper functions such as `select_if()` and `mutate_at()` in dplyr 1.0.0

- [tidymodels](http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2020-03-25_machine_learning/): an introduction to the tidymodels package for conducting Machine Learning in a tidy way

- [purrr](http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2019-08-19_purrr/): an introduction to the purrr R package for iteration

- The [tidyverse](http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2019-08-05_base_r_to_tidyverse/): a two part summary of the tidyverse, aimed at helping practitioners transition from base R to the tidyverse. [Part 1](http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2019-08-05_base_r_to_tidyverse/) focuses on tidy thinking, piping, dplyr and ggplot2, and [Part 2](http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2019-08-05_base_r_to_tidyverse_pt2/) focuses on tidyr, purrr, readr, tibbles as well as lubridate, forcats and stringr

- [recipes](http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2019-06-06_pre_processing/): an introduction to using the recipes R package for pre-processing data prior to machine learning

- [scoped verbs](http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2019-01-23_scoped-verbs/): a summary of the usage of dplyr scoped verbs such as `mutate_if()`, `summarise_all()`, `rename_at()`

- [caret](http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2017-11-17-caret_tutorial/): an introduction to caret prepared for STAT215A. [(Jupyter notebook)](https://github.com/rlbarter/STAT-215A-Fall-2017/tree/master/week11)

## Statistics

- [ANOVA](http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2017-02-17-anova/): an intuitive explanation of ANOVA prepared for the Practical Statistics group.
