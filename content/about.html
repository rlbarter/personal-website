<p>Hi there! I’m Rebecca Barter. I’m so glad you’ve made it to my page.</p>
<p>I’m a data scientist, educator and communicator whose primary passion is to empower others by teaching critical thinking and technical skills for data science. I spend most of my time working towards improving current approaches to teaching statistics, data literacy and communication, both at introductory and advanced levels.</p>
<p>Originally from Australia, I moved to California in 2014 and graduated from my PhD in Statistics at UC Berkeley in December 2019, during which time I was advised primarily by Prof Bin Yu. During much of my PhD I was a Data Science Fellow at the <a href="https://bids.berkeley.edu">Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS)</a>. My PhD research focused on data science in healthcare (such as predicting surgical site infections using electronic health records).</p>
<p>As an experienced educator, certified RStudio instructor, and certified Software Carpentry instructor, I have taught more than 20 R and data science-related workshops, and have helped hundreds of thousands of people worldwide learn R and statistics through this blog.</p>
<p>My primary upcoming project is a book, “<em>Veridical Data Science: The Practice of Responsible Data Analysis and Decision Making</em>”, that I am co-authoring with my PhD advisor and ongoing mentor, Professor Bin Yu. Veridical Data Science combines Professor Yu’s decades-long experience in the field of data science and her innovative <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/8/3920">Veridical Data Science framework</a> with my enthusiasm for explaining complex data science topics in a simple and intuitive way. We hope that <em>Veridical Data Science</em> can be a practical handbook for new (and old) Data Scientists, and hope that it will play a significant role in the education of the next generation of data scientists. <em>Veridical Data Science</em> will be published by MIT Press sometime in 2022. Stay tuned!</p>
<!-- In the past, I have dabbled in writing software as the author of the [superheat](https://github.com/rlbarter/superheat) R package for creating beautiful and customizable heatmaps in R. -->
<!-- When I'm not doing R or stats stuff, I'm usually found hiking, climbing rocks somewhere, taking photos of beautiful places, painting, or throwing mugs and bowls at the pottery studio! -->
