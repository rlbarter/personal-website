<p>If you want to work with me, or learn R or statistics from me, I’m available for private coaching and consulting! Email me at <a href="mailto:rebeccabarter@berkeley.edu" class="email">rebeccabarter@berkeley.edu</a> to inquire.</p>
<p>I’m not currently teaching at Berkeley, but the courses I’ve TA’d for are listed below.</p>

<h2>[Lecturer] Spring 2022: STAT 135 Concepts in Statistics</h2>
<p>I was the lecturer for this core statistics undergraduate focusing on common methods in statistics such as MLE, the bootstrap, hypothesis testing and linear models.</p>
<p>The slides I created for this class can be found on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/rlbarter/STAT135_Sp22" class="uri">https://github.com/rlbarter/STAT135_Sp22</a></p>

<h2>[GSI/TA] Fall 2017: STAT 215A Statistical Models, Theory and Applications</h2>
<p>A graudate course in applied statistics taught by Bin Yu. The course covers a wide range of topics that focus on critical thinking for using statistics in the wild. I taught a section each week where I either re-inforced content the students were learning in class, or ran tutorials in a variety of topics in R.</p>
<p>The materials that I prepared can be found in the following github repository: <a href="https://github.com/rlbarter/STAT-215A-Fall-2017" class="uri">https://github.com/rlbarter/STAT-215A-Fall-2017</a>.</p>

<h2>[GSI/TA] Spring 2015: STAT 135 Concepts in Statistics</h2>
<p>An undergraduate course focusing on common methods in statistics such as MLE, the bootstrap, hypothesis testing and linear models. The instructor for this course was Joan Bruna. I taught a section each week on a topic related to what the students were learning in class.</p>
