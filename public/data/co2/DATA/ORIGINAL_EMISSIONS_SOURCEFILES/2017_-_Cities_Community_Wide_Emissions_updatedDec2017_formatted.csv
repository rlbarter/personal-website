Results of this preliminary analysis of 2010 and 2015 GHG emissions reveals Chicago continued to reduce total GHG emissions through 2015 in the stationary and waste sectors resulting in a greater than 7 percent reduction in GHG emissions over the last five years. During that time, Chicago’s population grew by approximately 1 percent while the region’s GRP grew by more than 12 percent. Growth coupled with reduction in total emissions resulted in a greater than 8 percent decrease in per capita emissions in the City. Between 2010 and 2015, the majority of MT CO2e reductions occurred in the stationary energy sector, followed by waste. When considering percent reductions, the waste sector experienced the greatest reduction (30 percent) which included a 35 percent emissions reduction in the solid waste disposal sub-sector. This reduction in the solid waste sector is likely driven by a decrease in the total amount of solid waste sent to landfills and an improvement in the solid waste treatment technologies at those landfills. The City expanded its residential curbside recycling pilot program to now serve over 400,000, or approximately 33 percent, of additional City houeholds.Because of the program’s expansion the City experienced a significant increase in the number of tons collected for recycling, from 58,000 in 2010 to 97,000 in 2015. The stationary energy sector overall saw a 10 percent drop in emissions, including 11, 12 and 8 percent emissions reductions in the residential, commercial and institutional buildings and facilities, and manufacturing industries and construction sub-sectors, respectively. Stationary energy sector GHG emissions reductions are likely driven by a general trend in the building industry to improve energy efficiency of buildings as well as a regional shift in energy generation towards renewable energy sources.

There was a 5.6% increase in emissions (2000-2005, with large emitters).   When the baseline inventory was completed, the team predicted that by 2010, emissions (w/ large industrial emitters) would increase 9% from 2005 to 4.6 million metric tons.  If large emitters were still included, then the increase between 2005 and 2010 was only a 24% increase, 15% more than what was originally predicted.  However, for 2010, it was decided to exclude large emitters.  This means that increases in all other sectors have a greater impact on total emissions, i.e. the increase in transportation emissions has a much greater impact on overall emissions levels.   The roughly 35% increase between 2005 and 2010 could be due to a number of things including changes in reporting protocols, e.g. permitting requirements changed or the non-recession years outweighed the recession years.  It could also be that Benicia was not as hard hit by the recession as other communities and therefore, emissions didn't decrease. Again, educated guesses have been made as to what caused the increase.    Please note that vehicle miles travelled (VMT) grew between 2000 and 2010 by 62%, while emissions increased 95%.  The % of total emissions from transportation is within the Bay Area average. The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) calculates VMT using a proprietary software model. MTC inputs traffic counts, vehicle speeds, vehicle make and model, and fuel data into its software. In 2010, per the change in the modeling software, Benicia is now responsible for 50% of the trips that start elsewhere but end in Benicia and trips that start in Benicia but end elsewhere. This is calculated based on the number of people that exit or enter the highway in Benicia. Pass through VMT is not attributed to Benicia. Then, emissions are calculated by inputting VMT into the CACP software, which generates a GHG equivalent (MTCO2e). The increase in off road emissions is due to construction permit projections for buildings, which may have never been built. However, estimating off road emissions using construction permit data is the recommended calculation method per ICLEI’s protocol and guidance.",27450,2014,"(38.049365, -122.1585777)","(37.09024, -95.712891)"

A total reduction of approximately 6% in community-wide emissions was observed compared to the last verified inventory carried out during CY2012. The Stationary Energy sector emissions decreased ~11% because natural gas and electricity consumption decreased across all sub-sectors. The Transportation sector emissions decreased by ~3% predominately affected by significant decreases in the Waterborne Navigation and On-road Transporation subsectors.  This occurred despite an emissions increase in the Railways sub-sector emissions which was affected by a methodology change in the way Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) began collecting more specific power data and their use of a more conservative or higher emissions factor starting CY2013. Regarding the Waste sector, first, wastewater fugitive data collection was improved with better activity data.  This resulted in a more accurate picture of the contribution of fugitive wastewater emissions; thus, cutting by nearly half what was originally reporting in 2012. Consequently, when we compare the Waste sector since last inventoried,  emissions actually increased 18% influenced by not only an increase in total wastewater treatment and discharge emissions, but also because of an 18% increase in solid waste disposed emissions.  The updated CY2013 waste characterization study was more detailed which allowed a closer look at organic waste.  As a result, the category ""Other Organic Waste"" is now included as organic; previously categorized as inorganic.  Recategorization alone resulted in a 9% emissions increase. The remaining 9% was a result of an increase in ood+Textiles as well as Paper landfilled and thus emissions at ~5% and 4%, respectively.

Total emissions in this sector increased between 1990 and 2008, however, they have been decreasing since 2008. Advances in vehicle technology, plus a trend towards fewer vehicle miles travelled per person, have led both to decreased absolute emissions from road transportation (down 2% since 2008) and decreased emissions per person (down 13% during this period). Between 2008 and 2014, building-related emissions declined as a result of lower overall building energy use, particularly for residential buildings, due to energy efficiency, more multi-family living, and especially by warmer weather that reduced winter heating needs. This decline, though modest, is more impressive considering Seattle’s population and economy have grown considerably since 1990.  On a per resident basis, Seattle’s emissions declined  22% per since 1990 and 6% since 2008. A number of factors led to emissions decreases that counteracted the effect of population and economic growth, especially (as already noted) the decrease in carbon intensity of Seattle City Light’s electricity, more efficient cars and trucks, and building efficiency (including smaller dwellings) and fuel switching.

As in 2013, the scope 1 emissions are dominated by transport emissions, which have remained fairly constant across the period, demonstrating a 5kt increase. This change is largely due to increases in estimates in private marine fuel consumption after the use of more detailed, disaggregated fuel import data, as described in Section 4.2.1 of the inventory report. IPPU emissions remain a significant source of scope 1 emissions, and have also increased by 1kt in comparison to 2013. Emissions in this sector are estimated using population as a proxy, and therefore population growth within Gibraltar will have somewhat influenced the calculated increase in scope 1 emissions. Improved data has also been used to calculate IPPU emissions in Gibraltar; for example, activity data regarding MDIs and N2O use has been provided by the Gibraltar Health Authority, rather than relying on scaling UK data. When scope 2 emissions are considered, there is a 30kt decline in total emissions. A reduction in consumed gas oil used for electricity generation and an apparent improvement of the implied emission factor cause a decline in emissions from residential, and commercial, industrial, and government buildings and facilities. This is largely responsible for this trend. Waterborne navigation emissions have declined due to a methodology change within the calculation of emissions from shipping. As outlined in Section 4.2.3 of the inventory report, the definition of shipping attributable to Gibraltar on the basis of the recorded ‘purpose of call’ has undergone significant changes, and as a result, the emissions from scope 3 are largely reduced in 2015. Because of a large number of method changes, an updated reporting approach using the now-finalised GPC, and data for the 2015 inventory method not being available for updating the 2013 inventory, it is not possible to confidently identify how much change in emissions is due to changing method versus changing activity. Future years will seek to ensure that the time series is revised where possible to allow such comparisons to be made.",33528,2015,"(36.1407734, -5.3535994)","(36.140751, -5.353585)"
