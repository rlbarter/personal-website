<p>This week is the <a href="https://bids.github.io/docathon/">Docathon</a> at <a href="https://bids.berkeley.edu/">BIDS</a> (a.k.a. that wonderful place that I spend all my time).</p>
<p>A docathon is like a hackathon but is focused on developing material and tools for documentation. We have <a href="https://bids.github.io/docathon/pages/projects/projects.html">loads of projects</a> signed up to receive some documentation-love and an impressive number of excited participants!</p>
<p><img src="/img/docathon/docathon.jpg-large" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We kicked off the event with a series of tutorials for writing “good” documentation. I gave an R-specific tutorial where I discussed using devtools to both develop and document your package. I ended with a sneak peak into bookdown book-based documentation for complex packages. Skip ahead to 1:54:02 to hear my presentation!</p>
